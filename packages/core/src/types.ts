/**
 * Locked v0.1 shape returned by every `call_template` invocation, regardless
 * of the underlying template. See docs/RESPONSE_BUDGET.md § `call_template`
 * for the rationale.
 *
 * Rules (enforced at the Lua dispatcher, not in individual templates):
 *
 * - `changed_count` is the **true** count of items the template mutated.
 * - `changed_ids` is capped at 50 entries in mutation order. If
 *   `changed_count > 50` then `truncated: true` and the array contains the
 *   first 50.
 * - The result NEVER embeds `ItemDescriptor` or other rich payloads, even
 *   for single-item mutations. Agents read post-state via
 *   `get_state(ids=[...])` (v0.1: ids filter unimplemented — the agent
 *   reads `selection` and matches on returned GUIDs).
 *
 * This shape is the same for read-only, write-safe, filesystem-touching,
 * and (eventually) destructive templates. Bridge dispatcher normalizes —
 * individual handlers only return `{ changed_ids = [...] }`.
 *
 * `changed_ids` entry shape — and the one carve-out:
 *
 * Every template except `render_region` uses project-entity refs:
 *   "guid:{...}"  — item or track GUID
 *   "region:NAME" — region (no native GUID API in REAPER 7)
 *   "track:Name"  — bare track name (rare)
 *
 * `render_region` is the SINGLE carve-out: its `changed_ids` carries
 * absolute artifact paths (e.g. `["/Users/.../var_01.wav"]`). The deviation
 * is documented in docs/RESPONSE_BUDGET.md § call_template — don't
 * generalize. If you're writing a new template and unsure: does the thing
 * the handler produced exist inside the project as a REAPER entity? Yes →
 * entity ref. No → revisit the carve-out section before shipping.
