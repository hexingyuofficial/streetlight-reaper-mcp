/**
 * `render_region` — render a single project region to a WAV file on disk.
 *
 * v0.1 is the first (and only) consumer of the bridge's deferred-completion
 * protocol: the Lua handler kicks off `Main_OnCommand(42230, 0)` and then
 * yields, letting the bridge re-check the output file on subsequent defer
 * ticks rather than busy-waiting. The asynchrony is BRIDGE-INTERNAL — the
 * agent only ever sees the normal `Result<CallTemplateResult>` envelope,
 * never a `state: "rendering"` sentinel. See docs/RENDER_NOTES.md.
 * Slice 15 makes the deferred terminal envelope eligible for bridge-level
 * idempotency replay; this is transport-level retry safety and does not
 * change the template's `idempotent: false` metadata below.
 *
 * Locked v0.1 output policy (intentionally hardcoded, not exposed as
 * params): format = WAV / 24-bit PCM, channels = 2 (stereo), sample rate =
 * project rate. Future formats land in v0.2.
 *
 * Result envelope deviation worth pinning here: `render_region` is the
 * single template whose `changed_ids` carries artifact paths
 * (`["/abs/path/region_name.wav"]`) rather than project entity refs
 * (`guid:{...}` / `region:NAME` / `track:Name`). Every other template stays
 * with the project-entity-ref convention. Do NOT generalize this carve-out
 * to other templates — see docs/RESPONSE_BUDGET.md § call_template for the
 * locked rationale.
 *
 * Domain-shape rejection (matches the Step 5 region-name pattern): TS only
 * enforces structural shape (`min(1)` on both fields). Path-existence,
 * directory-vs-file, writability, and target-file collision live in the
 * Lua handler so the agent-facing surface is OUTPUT_DIR_MISSING /
 * OUTPUT_DIR_NOT_WRITABLE / OUTPUT_FILE_EXISTS rather than the generic
 * PARAMS_INVALID a Zod refinement would force.
